🪖 Smart Adaptive Camouflage Suit  
“A living uniform that adapts, protects, and heals.”

🌍 Overview  
The **Smart Adaptive Camouflage Suit** is a next-generation concept blending **AI, nanotechnology, and real-time physiological monitoring**.  
It demonstrates how an intelligent nanofabric system can adapt its camouflage pattern to match terrain conditions, self-regulate temperature, monitor health vitals, and trigger danger alerts in extreme scenarios.  
This Streamlit-based software prototype simulates the intelligent behaviour of such a suit, offering an interactive dashboard where **environmental inputs and AI responses** evolve dynamically.

🎯 Objectives  
- Develop a **software simulation** of an adaptive camouflage suit using **AI-driven environmental sensing**.  
- Demonstrate **real-time monitoring** of physiological and environmental metrics.  
- Showcase **AI-based decision-making** for mode switching: Cool, Heat, Stealth, and Alert.  
- Visualise adaptive camouflage through **terrain-aware gradient transitions**.  

🧩 Features  
✅ AI-based mode prediction (Cool, Heat, Stealth, Alert)  
✅ Adaptive camouflage visuals blending terrain and suit state  
✅ Real-time vitals: Temperature, Heart Rate, SpO₂, Respiration, Oxygen, Radiation, Pressure, Battery  
✅ Dynamic “Alert Mode” — red pulsating warning with danger feedback  
✅ CSV data export for analytics  
✅ QR code link generator for GitHub repo or deployment link  

🧠 How It Works  
1. **Sensor Simulation** – Python simulates environmental and physiological data (temperature, light, heart rate).  
2. **AI Logic** – Rules emulate AI decision-making to determine operational mode.  
3. **Camouflage Rendering** – Dynamic terrain-based gradients visualise suit adaptation.  
4. **Dashboard** – Streamlit displays metrics, vitals, and live performance graphs.  
5. **Alert System** – Critical conditions trigger intense red pulsation for hazard indication.
